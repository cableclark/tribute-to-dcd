The band's official website stated that the album title was taken "from 19th Century symbolist ideals". The title is directly taken from "Spleen et Id√©al", a collection of poems by French poet Charles Baudelaire which form a section of his magnum opus Les Fleurs du mal.

Discussing the album's musical style, AllMusic commented that with Spleen and Ideal, Dead Can Dance "fully took the plunge into the heady mix of musical traditions that would come to define its sound and style for the remainder of its career.
