      <h3>Spiritchaser</h3>
      <p>Spiritchaser is the seventh studio album by Dead Can Dance, and would prove to be the last before the duo reunited fourteen years later for Anastasis. It expands on its exploration of world music, and like Into the Labyrinth, was recorded at Quivvy Church, Perry's personal studio in Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>The album was dedicated to Lisa Gerrard's deceased brother, Mark Gerrard.
